# Hacking the Open Context Search + Mapping API

This repository has a small bit of javascript code and a very simple HTML page for demonstrating use of the new Open Context API. The code here provides a starting point for using the API for making customized views, maps, and visualizations of data served from Open Context.

To view the little bit of code in action (and this is VERY rough, not very well styled, and with limited features), check out:

The primary documentation for Open Context can be found here:

Enjoy!
