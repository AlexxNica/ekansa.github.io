# Hacking the Open Context Search + Mapping API

This repository has a small bit of javascript code and a very simple HTML page for demonstrating use of the new Open Context API. The code here provides a starting point for using the API for making customized views, maps, and visualizations of data served from Open Context.

The primary documentation for Open Context can be found here:

Enjoy!
